## üöÄ Installation / Getting Started

**[Option 1: If you provide an Installer (e.g., using electron-builder)]**

2.  Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

**[Option 2: If you provide a Portable Version (e.g., a .zip file with the .exe)]**

2.  Extract the contents of the `.zip` file to a folder on your computer.
3.  Run `Symphonie.exe` from the extracted folder.

**Important Note for Windows Users:**
Since this application is not signed with a commercial developer certificate, Windows SmartScreen or other antivirus software might display a warning when you first try to run the installer or the executable. This is normal for unsigned applications.
